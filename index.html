    <div class="ans">
        <p>This year was really amazing for the Chapel of Grace Teenagers. We had a lot of events, all of which were extremely wonderful</p>
        
        <p>*****</p>
        
        <p>My favorite out of all the activities was when we, the Teenagers, were given <b>The Purpose Driven Life</b>, a book written by <b>Rick Warren</b>, and were instructed to try and complete reading it in 40 days. (Which is how the book is meant to be read)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ans">
        <p>The Purpose Driven Life really changed how I viewed the world and taught me a lot of things which I will cherish in my heart forever. Such as:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Having the mindset that Earth is not where we belong and we should not be distracted by the things of this world, constantly setting our eyes on the Heavenly Prize
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Recognizing GOD as your lifeline (Without GOD life makes no sense)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>GOD is our creator and we have been in his care even before we were born (Isaiah 44:2), so trust in Him
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                We were placed on earth to prepare us for eternity
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The only accurate way to understand ourselves is by what GOD is and by what he does for us.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                We must be able to recognize use well our GOD given gifts
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Anything you do that brings pleasure to GOD is an act of worship
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Endeavour to make GOD smile by praising and thanking Him for all He has done
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Surrender your whole being to HIM to be used for righteous purposes
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Being Aware of others and putting them first
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
